# Project One: Sassy Dogs


## Description
Sassy Pets is a pet adoption website to allow prospective pet owners the ability to search through available pets in their area. In order to increase likelihood of adoption, funny jokes are added to each available pet to help users make a connection to the pet. Additional information about each pet is listed under their picture including name, breed, size, gender, age, color, coat, adoption organization & location, and personality traits (good with children, good with dogs, good with cats, house-trained). Search options include zip code and certain traits (animal type, size, age, gender). Searchable traits are presented in a humorous manner to select from a dropdown menu (ex: type of animal: cat, size: fat, age: old, gender: dude).
