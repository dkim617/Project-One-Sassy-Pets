# Project One: Sassy Pets


## Description
Pet adoption website to allow prospective pet owners the ability to search through available pets in their area. In order to increase likelihood of adoption, funny jokes are added to each available pet to help users make a connection to the dog. Search criteria include zip code as well as humorous animal descriptions to choose from a dropdown menu (i.e. type: cat, size: fat, age: old). Additional information about each dog is listed under their picture including name, breed, size, gender, age, color, coat, adoption organization & location, and personality traits (good with children, good with dogs, good with cats, house-trained).

## User Story: 
As a pet lover I'm looking for a quick and fun way to adopt a pet with attitude.
